#Foetal Health Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of a foetal health dataset, exploring various factors related to the health of foetuses. The analysis is done using R Markdown, and the results are presented in a PowerPoint presentation.

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this analysis contains information related to the cardiotocograms (CTGs) of 2126 foetuses. It includes various attributes such as foetal heart rate (FHR), uterine contractions (UC), foetal movements (FM), and other clinical features.

Analysis projet_ue_H final.Rmd, contains the detailed analysis of the dataset. The analysis includes the following steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and characteristics of the variables.
Data preprocessing steps such as scaling numerical features.
Building predictive models to classify foetal health based on the given features.
Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualizations to illustrate key insights from the data.
